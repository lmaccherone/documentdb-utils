_Drop-in replacement + extensions for DocumentDB node.js client with auto-retry on 429 errors plus a lot more_

By functionality like automatic retries on 429 errors among other things, documentdb-utils makes it much easier to use Microsoft Azure DocumentDB from node.js.

Note, versions prior to 0.4.0 had a very different interface exposed as documentDBUtils. That has now been removed in favor of this drop-in replacement + extensions approach.


## Source code ##

* [Source Repository](https://github.com/lmaccherone/documentdb-utils)


## Features ##

### Drop-in enhanced functionality ###

* All methods and functionality of the Microsoft Azure node.js client with the exact same signature so you can drop this into your code and get an instantaneos upgrade.

* Automatically handles 429 throttling responses by retrying after the delay specified by the prior operation.

* Automatically deals with early termination of stored procedures for exceeding resources. Just follow a simple pattern (memoization like that used in a reduce function) for writing your stored procedures. The state will be shipped back to the calling side and the stored procedure will be called again picking back up right where it left off.

### Extended functionality ###

* `<old-method>Array(..., callback)` as short-hand for `.toArray()` calls. Example:  `readDocumentsArray(collectionLink, callback)`

* `<old-method>Multi(linkArray, ..., callback)` and `<old-method>ArrayMulti(linkArray, ..., callback)` as automatic fan-out to multiple collections, sprocs, etc. for each method whose first parameter is a link. If you want to run the same query against multiple collections or call a sproc by the same name in different collections, you can now do that with one line. The results are automatically aggregated into a single callback response. Example: `executeStoredProcedureMulti(arrayOfCollecitonLinks, 'countDocuments', callback)`.

* Stats on the number of round trips and RU costs used by each operation even when the operation is expanded to many low-level operations.

* `<old-method>AsyncJSIterator(item, callback)` wrapper of methods to enable use of async.js's higher order functions like map, filter, etc. This is used internally to provide the multi-link capability but you can use it yourself to compose your own.

### The kitchen sink ###

* link and link array generator. Example: `getLinkArray('myDB', [1, 2], 'mySproc')` results in `['dbs/myDB/colls/1/sprocs/mySproc', 'dbs/myDB/colls/2/sprocs/mySproc']`

* expandSproc functionality allows you to "require" npm modules from within your stored procedures as well as DRY for utility functions in your sprocs

* loadSprocs/loadUDFs automatically expands and loads every sproc/UDF in a directory to a list of collections

* countDocuments, createSpecificDocuments, createVariedDocuments, deleteSomeDocuments, updateSomeDocuments sprocs to use as-is or as a starting point for your own sprocs

* getUnderscore mixin for sprocs which returns an object that implements the [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) API (couldn't get lodash to work). Yes, this works inside of sprocs.

* getAsync mixin for sprocs which returns an object that implements the [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) API. Again, you can use this from sprocs.

* [lodash](https://lodash.com) and [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) exported as _ and async respectively

* [sql-from-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-from-mongo) exported as sqlFromMongo

* documentdb.Base.generateGuidId exported and aliased as getGUID in addition to generateGuidId



## Install ##

`npm install -save documentdb-utils`


## Usage ##

If you put your urlConnection and masterkey in DOCUMENT_DB_URL and DOCUMENT_DB_KEY environment variables (recommended), you can simply `new WrappedClient()` with no parameters.

    {WrappedClient} = require('documentdb-utils')
    client = new WrappedClient()
    
If you want to use environment variables for the first two parameters but specify a connectionPolicy and/or consistencyLevel, then simply pass in null for the first two parameters.

    {WrappedClient} = require('documentdb-utils')
    client = new WrappedClient(null, null, connectionPolicy, consistencyLevel)
    
You can also pass in the same parameters as the Azure client (urlConnection, auth, connectionPolicy, consistencyLevel) with the last two being optional.

    {WrappedClient} = require('documentdb-utils')
    client = new WrappedClient(urlConnection, auth, connectionPolicy, consistencyLevel)

Alternatively, if you've already created your own instance of the Azure client, you can pass that in as the first parameter.

    {WrappedClient} = require('documentdb-utils')
    {DocumentClient} = require('documentdb')
    _client = new DocumentClient(urlConnection, auth)
    client = new WrappedClient(_client)

### A Stored Procedure Example ###

Let's say you wrote this little stored procedure and saved it in hello.coffee.

    exports.hello = () ->
      getContext().getResponse().setBody('Hello world!')
      
or if you prefer JavaScript saved in hello.js.

    exports.hello = function () {
      getContext().getResponse().setBody('Hello world!');
    }
   
Now let's write some CoffeeScript (or equivalent JavaScript) to send and execute this on two different collections:

    TBD
  
Execute with something like: `coffee tryHello.coffee`. You should see `Hello world!` as your output.

    TBD

## Pattern for writing stored procedures ##

**The key to a general pattern for writing restartable stored procedures is to write them as if you were writing a reduce() function.**

Note, if you follow this pattern, the upgraded `executeStoredProcedure()` automatically deals with early termination of stored procedures for exceeding resources. Just follow this simple pattern. The state will be shipped back to the calling side and the stored procedure will be called again picking back up right where it left off.

Pehaps the most common use of stored procedures is to aggregate or transform data. It's very easy to think of these as "reduce" operations just like Array.reduce() or the reduce implementations in underscore, async.js, or just about any other library with aggregation functionality. It stretches the "reduce" metaphore a bit, but the pattern itself is perfectly usefull even for stored procedures that write data.

So:

1. Only accept one parameter -- a JavaScript Object. Let's name it `memo`.
1. Support an empty or missing `memo` on the initial call.
1. Store any variable that represents the current running state of the stored procedure into the `memo` object.
1. Store the `continuation` field returned by readDocuments and queryDocuments into `memo.continuation`. If you are doing only creates, updates, and deletes or even a set of readDocument() calls within your sproc and you want it to pause and resume for some reason, then set `continuation` manually (value doesn't matter).
1. Store in the field called `stillQueueing` the boolean value returned by the last collection operation. (NOTE: We may be able to remove this if/when we remove the sproc delete and upsert hack.)
1. Optionally store any internal visibility (debugging, timings, etc.) into the `memo` object.
1. Call `getContext().getResponse().setBody(memo)` regulary, particularly right after you kick off a collection operation (readDocuments, createDocument, etc.).
1. If `false` is returned from the most recent call to a collection operation, don't issue any more async calls. Rather, wrap up the stored procedure quickly.

Here is an example of a stored procedure that counts all the documents in a collection with an option to filter based upon provided filterQuery field in the initial memo. The source for this is included in this repository.

    count = (memo) ->
    
      collection = getContext().getCollection()
    
      unless memo?
        memo = {}
      unless memo.count?
        memo.count = 0
      unless memo.continuation?
        memo.continuation = null
    
      memo.stillQueueing = true
    
      query = (responseOptions) ->
    
        if memo.stillQueueing
          responseOptions =
            continuation: memo.continuation
            pageSize: 1000
    
          if memo.filterQuery?
            memo.stillQueueing = collection.queryDocuments(collection.getSelfLink(), memo.filterQuery, responseOptions, onReadDocuments)
          else
            memo.stillQueueing = collection.readDocuments(collection.getSelfLink(), responseOptions, onReadDocuments)
    
        setBody()
    
      onReadDocuments = (err, resources, options) ->
        if err
          throw err
    
        count = resources.length
        memo.count += count
        if options.continuation?
          memo.continuation = options.continuation
          query()
        else
          memo.continuation = null
          setBody()
    
      setBody = () ->
        getContext().getResponse().setBody(memo)
    
      query()
    
    exports.count = count

* 0.4.0 - 2015-12-05 - **WARNING - Major backward breaking changes** 
  Since documentdb-utils was introduced, DocumentDB has added id-based links, upserts, and maxItemCount = -1. The lack of these
  features were 3 of the 4 primary motivations for the creation of documentdb-utils. The only remaining big motivator is
  authomatic retries upon 429 errors. However, I now believe that the best way to provide that is by wrapping the appropriate methods
  of the Azure-provided DocumentDB node.js API. This new approach makes documentdb-utils much easier to
  utilize since it has the same API as the Azure-provided one. You can now add documentdb-utils in one place
  and not modify the rest of your code. Previously, documentdb-utils had a monolithic single function API that looked
  very different from the Azure-provided one. Also, it now supports every method of the Azure-provided API, whereas previously,
  documentdb-utils only supported stored procedures and single-document operations. Nearly every line of code in this package has been rewritten to accomplish 
  this transformation. Further, I've built a number of other useful utilities including enabling 
  code reuse for stored procedures by allowing you to `require()` other bits of code or even appropriate npm modules 
  directly in your sprocs as well as automatic loading of all stored procedures in a given directory. This additional utility was
  implemented as part of other projects but it's generally useful so it's now been moved here. 
* 0.3.4 - 2015-07-14 - Finally got rid of the delete/recreate hack when just terminated for out of time. Still deletes/recreates if get 403 blacklist message 
* 0.3.3 - 2015-07-12 - Will delete and recreate sprocs that have been blacklisted
* 0.3.2 - 2015-07-12 - Returns total RUs in stats
* 0.3.1 - 2015-07-09 - Upgraded to latest version of documentdb API
* 0.3.0 - 2015-07-01 - **WARNING - Backward breaking change** Restored the hack where it
  deletes and upserts sprocs whenever they receive a false from a collection operation. 
  To use this functionality, you need to pattern your sprocs such that they return a 
  `stillQueueing` field in the body. This is just the last recorded value returned from 
  a collection operation. It's backward breaking because the key field is now 
  `stillQueueing` whereas it was previously `stillQueueingOperations`.
* 0.2.5 - 2015-06-30 - Another bug fix
* 0.2.4 - 2015-06-30 - Bug fix
* 0.2.3 - 2015-06-30 - Restored the delete, upsert, and retry logic but this time only if you 
        get a 403 error and message indicating blacklisting
* 0.2.2 - 2015-06-30 - Revert to blacklisting hack because the bug doesn't seem to be fixed
* 0.2.1 - 2015-06-30 - Handle 408 error by retrying just like 429
* 0.2.0 - 2015-06-28 - Added repository link (meant to go 0.2 in prior version)

* 0.1.0 - 2015-05-03 - Initial release


## To-do (pull requests desired) ##

### Documentation ###

Because Microsoft uses JSDoc for its library, I've decided to use it also. that said, I don't yet have any documentation generation in place. That's pretty high on my list to do myself but it's also a good candidate for pull requests if anyone wants to help. Use this approach to document the CoffeeScript.

```
###*
# Sets the language and redraws the UI.
# @param {object} data Object with `language` property
# @param {string} data.language Language code
###
handleLanguageSet: (data) ->
```

outputs

```
/**
 * Sets the language and redraws the UI.
 * @param {object} data Object with `language` property
 * @param {string} data.language Language code
 */
handleLanguageSet: function(data) {}
```

### Tests ###

I use the relatively simplistic documentdb-mock for writing automated tests for my own stored procedures and I regularly exercise documentDBUtils in the course of running those stored procedures. I also have done extensive exploratory testing on DocumentDB's behavior using documentDBUtils... even finding some edge cases in DocumentDB's behavior. :-) However, you cannot run DoucmentDB locally and I don't have the patience to fully mock it out so there are currently less than full test coverage.
